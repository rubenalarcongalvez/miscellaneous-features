<h2 class="text-blue-600">Transitions with properties of Angular as ngClass or ngStyle</h2>
<hr>
<p>It usually happens that if you make transitions with ngClass or ngStyles, they do not appear to work. <button (click)="hidden = !hidden">Show/Hide content</button></p>

<main>
    <section [ngClass]="{'state2': state2}" (click)="state2 = !state2">
        Click me
    </section>

    <section class="hidden-section" [ngClass]="{'show-content': !hidden}">
        Hey! I was hidden ðŸ’­
    </section>
</main>
